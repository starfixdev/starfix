# starfish-demo
Demonstrates open in IDE Option on Github


_As a mockup we open `apt` instead of starfish(as it is not developed yet)_

- on site load it prompts to add url handler extension:site wants to *`open web+apt links`* with two options *`block`* and *`allow`*
- click allow to register apt
- now click on open in starfish to launch apt
- it will prompt to `open xdg-open`
- click on `open-xdg-open` 
- note that we are trigerring apt with the url for mockup 
- ofcourse it is an invalid package so t will give error
